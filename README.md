# SES-230-final
My final project for 'Coding for Exploration'! They're all battleship games.

My uploaded .ipynb file contains all of my work before Dec. 3, 4:00 pm. There are two main cells in the file, one using top-down design and one using object-oriented design. 
The top-down design is more finished, and includes different ways to play: user vs. computer, or many simulated computer vs. computer games.
